## Overview
This project is a simple yet advanced To-Do List web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks. Users can add tasks with due dates, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and even drag-and-drop tasks to reorder them. All task data is stored in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring that data persists across page reloads.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can input a task name and a due date, and the task will be added to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can click on the task text to toggle its completion status, which will strike through the text.
- **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
- **Reorder Tasks**: The tasks are draggable, allowing users to reorder them by dragging and dropping.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring data is saved even after the page is reloaded.
- **Edit tasks** in place
